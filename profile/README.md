## Why CircleSync?

- ⚡️ **Lightning Fast.** CircleSync creates Outline VPN servers in all AWS regions within 5 minutes.
- 🔒 **Secure.** VPN ports are restricted to your IP address only, making the VPN access key unusable even if exposed.
- 🎯 **Flexible.** You can maintain VPN servers only while using them and quickly delete them when not needed.
- 🛡️ **Private.** Since customers own their VPN servers, no logs are kept
